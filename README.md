# Real-Time Turkish Car Plate Recognition System

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a real-time car plate recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and Flutter. The system will capture video feed, process frames to detect Turkish car plates, and extract plate numbers using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The recognized plate numbers, along with the date and time of detection, will be stored in JSON format and managed using an SQLite database. The project will include both web and mobile (Android) versions with a user interface developed using Flutter.

## Project Components

1. **Real-Time Video Processing**: 
   - Captures video feed in real-time.
   - Processes each frame (15FPS) to detect and recognize Turkish car plates.
   - Uses OpenCV for image processing and OCR.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Stores recognized car plate numbers along with date and time in JSON format.
   - Manages data using SQLite database for both web and mobile versions.

3. **User Interface**:
   - **Web**: Provides a web-based interface using Flutter.
   - **Mobile**: Develops an Android app with Flutter.

4. **Algorithms**:
   - Implements algorithms for converting car plate images to string format.
   - Uses OCR techniques to extract text from images.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For video processing and car plate recognition using OpenCV.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and car plate detection.
- **Tesseract OCR**: For Optical Character Recognition to read text from images.
- **SQLite**: For managing and storing data in a database.
- **Flutter**: For developing user interfaces for both web and mobile applications.

## Installation and Setup

### Python Environment

1. Install required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python pytesseract
    ```

2. Install Tesseract OCR. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

### SQLite Database

1. Set up an SQLite database to store car plate data. The database schema will include tables for storing plate numbers, dates, and times.

### Flutter

1. Set up Flutter for developing web and mobile applications. Follow the installation guide on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

## Project Structure

```
/project-root
    /python
        - car_plate_recognition.py
        - utils.py
    /flutter
        /web
        /android
    /database
        - schema.sql
    README.md
```

- **`car_plate_recognition.py`**: Contains the main logic for video processing and car plate recognition.
- **`utils.py`**: Helper functions for image processing and OCR.
- **`schema.sql`**: SQL schema for setting up the SQLite database.
- **`/flutter/web`**: Web application code using Flutter.
- **`/flutter/android`**: Mobile application code using Flutter.

## Usage

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Start the video feed and process frames to detect car plates.
   - The script will output recognized plate numbers and store data in JSON format and SQLite database.

2. **Develop Flutter Applications**:
   - Build and deploy the web and mobile applications to display and manage car plate data.

## Future Work

- **Enhancements**:
  - Improve plate number recognition accuracy.  
  
- **Mobile Application**:
  - Integrate real-time video processing with the mobile app.
